# Lil Peeps Car Service - a Web App to calculate ridesharing fares

## Purpose
The client wanted a fare-estimating calculator that would take in the start and end locations input by a user, use the Google Maps API to calculate the duration/distance as well as display the route, and use these values in a formula to calculate the fare. The user will then fill out a form, pay using either Stripe or PayPal, and an email containing the form information will be sent to the user when the payment is complete.
