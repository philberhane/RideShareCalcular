# Lil Peeps Car Service - a Web App to calculate ridesharing fares

## Purpose
The client wanted a fare-estimating calculator that would:
Take in the start and end locations input by a user, use the Google Maps API to calculate the duration/distance as well as display the route, use these values in a formula to calculate the fare, have the user fill out a form, have the user pay using Stripe or PayPal, email the client the form information when the payment is complete.

## Technologies Used
This was built using HTML&CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Stripe API, PayPal Integration, and the Google Maps API.
